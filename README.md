Project Title: Mini Project: Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene 

# Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene

## Project Overview
This project involves downloading, analyzing, and interpreting the sequence of the human TNF gene, which encodes a proinflammatory cytokine called TNF. The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of sequence analysis.

## Objectives
- Download the human TNF gene sequence from NCBI.
- Translate the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.
- Identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the DNA sequence.
- Analyze the nucleotide composition of the sequence.
- Identify transcription factor binding sites.
- Search for functional motifs using MEME Suite.
- Predict coding and non-coding regions using GENSCAN.
- Convert sequence file formats using BioEdit.

## Prerequisites
- [NCBI Account](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
- [BioEdit](http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) (or alternative sequence analysis tools)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for MacOS users)
- [PROMO Tool](http://alggen.lsi.upc.es/cgi-bin/promo_v3/promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3)
- [MEME Suite](http://meme-suite.org/)
- [GENSCAN](http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html)

## Project Structure
- Completing a bunch of tasks accordingly and then organising the results.
- contains both notebooks and scripts.
